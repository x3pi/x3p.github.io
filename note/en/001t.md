## The blockchain paradigm

A valid state transition is one which comes about through a transaction.

$$
\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{t+1} \equiv \Upsilon\left(\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{t}, T\right)
$$

<i class="c"></i>$\Upsilon$ is the Ethereum state transition function.<br/>
<i class="c"></i>$\sigma$ allows components to store arbitrary state between transactions.<br/>
<i class="c"></i>$T$, is used to denote an Ethereum transaction.

<hr>

Mining is the process of dedicating effort (working) to bolster one series of transactions (a block) over any other potential competitor block.

$$
\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{t+1} \equiv \Pi\left(\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{t}, B\right)
$$

$$
B \equiv\left(\ldots,\left(T_{0}, T_{1}, \ldots\right)\right)
$$

$$
\Pi(\boldsymbol{\sigma}, B) \equiv \Omega\left(B, \Upsilon\left(\Upsilon\left(\sigma, T_{0}\right), T_{1}\right) \ldots\right)
$$

<i class="c"></i>$\Pi$ is the block-level statetransition function.<br/>
<i class="c"></i>$B$ is block<br/>
<i class="c"></i>$\Omega$ is the block-finalisation state transition function (a function that rewards a nominated party)

<hr>

Ethereum has an intrinsic currency, Ether, known also as ETH.<br/>
One Ether is defined as being $10^8$ Wei.<br/>
There exist other sub denominations of Ether:<br/>

Multiplier| Name
---|---
$10^{0}$| Wei
$10^{12}$|Szabo
$10^{15}$|Finney
$10^{18}$|Ether

## Conventions

Define a number of useful functions throughout:<br/>

$$\ell(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \mathbf{x}[\|\mathbf{x}\|-1]$$

## Blocks, state and transactions

### World State

The account state comprises the following four fields:

<b>nonce:</b> A scalar value equal to the number of transactions sent from this address or, in the case of accounts with associated code, the number of contract-creations made by this account. For account of address $a$ in state $\sigma$, this would be formally denoted $\boldsymbol{\sigma}[a]_{\boldsymbol{n}}$.

<b>balance:</b> A scalar value equal to the number of Wei owned by this address. Formally denoted $\boldsymbol{\sigma}[a]_{\boldsymbol{b}}$.

<b>storageRoot:</b> A 256-bit hash of the root node of a Merkle Patricia tree that encodes the storage contents of the account (a mapping between 256-bit integer values), encoded into the trie as a mapping from the Keccak 256-bit hash of the 256-bit integer keys to the RLP-encoded 256-bit integer values. The hash is formally denoted $\boldsymbol{\sigma}[a]_{\boldsymbol{s}}$.

<b>codeHash:</b> <span>$\mathrm{KEC}(\mathrm{b})= \boldsymbol{\sigma}[a]_{\boldsymbol{c}}$</span>.If the codeHash field is the Keccak-256 hash of the empty string, i.e. <span>$\boldsymbol{\sigma}[a]_{c}=\mathrm{KEC}(0)$</span>, then the node represents a simple account, sometimes referred to as a “non-contract” account.

<hr>

$$
\operatorname{TRIE}\left(L_{I}^{*}\left(\boldsymbol{\sigma}[a]_{\mathbf{s}}\right)\right) \equiv \boldsymbol{\sigma}[a]_{s}
$$

$$
L_{I}((k, v)) \equiv(\mathrm{KEC}(k), \operatorname{RLP}(v))
$$

$$
k \in \mathbb{B}_{32} \quad \wedge \quad v \in \mathbb{P}
$$

<hr>

Thus we may define a world-state collapse function $L_{S}$:

$$
L_{S}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) \equiv\{p(a): \boldsymbol{\sigma}[a] \neq \varnothing\}
$$

where

$$
p(a) \equiv\left(\mathrm{KEC}(a), \operatorname{RLP}\left(\left(\boldsymbol{\sigma}[a]_{n}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}[a]_{b}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}[a]_{s}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}[a]_{c}\right)\right)\right)
$$

<hr>

This function, $L_S$, is used alongside the trie function to provide a short identity (hash) of the world state. We assume:

$$
\forall a: \boldsymbol{\sigma}[a]=\varnothing \vee\left(a \in \mathbb{B}_{20} \wedge v(\boldsymbol{\sigma}[a])\right)
$$

where $v$ is the account validity function:

$$
v(x) \equiv x_{n} \in \mathbb{P}_{256} \wedge x_{b} \in \mathbb{P}_{256} \wedge x_{s} \in \mathbb{B}_{32} \wedge x_{c} \in \mathbb{B}_{32}
$$

### Homestead

A significant block number for compatibility with the public network is the block marking the transition between the Frontier and Homestead phases of the platform, which we denote with the symbol $N_{H},$ defined thus

$$
N_{H} \equiv 1,150,000
$$

The protocol was upgraded at this block, so this symbol appears in some equations to account for the changes.

### The Transaction

There are two types of transactions: those which result in message calls and those which result in the creation of new accounts with associated code (known informally as ‘contract creation). Both types specify a number of common fields:

<b>nonce</b>: The number of transactions sent by the sender; formal $T_n$

<b>gasPrice</b>: Cost of making a transaction $T_{p}$ (Wei)

<b>gasLimit</b>: A scalar value equal to the maximum amount of gas that should be used in executing this transaction. This is paid up-front, before any computation is done and may not be increased later; formally $T_{g} .$

<b>to</b>: The 160 -bit address of the message call's recipient or, for a contract creation transaction, $\varnothing,$ used here to denote the only member of <span>$\mathbb{B}_{0}$</span>; formally <span>$T_{t}$</span>.

<b>value</b>: A scalar value equal to the number of Wei to be transferred to the message call's recipient or, in the case of contract creation, as an endowment to the newly created account; formally $T_{v}$.

<b>v, r, s</b>: Values corresponding to the signature of the transaction and used to determine the sender of the transaction; formally $T_{w}, T_{r}$ and $T_{s} .$ This is expanded in Appendix F.

<b>init</b>: is an EVM-code fragment; it returns the body, a second fragment of code that executes each time the account receives a message call (either through a transaction or due to the internal execution of code). init is executed only once at account creation and gets discarded immediately thereafter.

<b>data</b>: An unlimited size byte array specifying the input data of the message call, formally $T_{\mathrm{d}} .$

For the present we simply assert that the sender of a given transaction $T$ can be represented with $S(T) .$

$$
L_{T}(T) \equiv\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{\left(T_{n}, T_{p}, T_{g}, T_{t}, T_{v}, T_{\mathbf{i}}, T_{w}, T_{r}, T_{s}\right)} & {\text { if } T_{t}=\varnothing} \\ {\left(T_{n}, T_{p}, T_{g}, T_{t}, T_{v}, T_{\mathbf{d}}, T_{w}, T_{r}, T_{s}\right)} & {\text { otherwise }}\end{array}\right.
$$

$$
\begin{array}{llll}{T_{n} \in \mathbb{P}_{256}} & {\wedge} & {T_{v} \in \mathbb{P}_{256}} & {\wedge T_{p} \in \mathbb{P}_{256}} & {\wedge} \\ {T_{g} \in \mathbb{P}_{256}} & {\wedge} & {T_{w} \in \mathbb{P}_{5}} & {\wedge} & {T_{r} \in \mathbb{P}_{256}} & {\wedge} \\ {T_{s} \in \mathbb{P}_{256}} & {\wedge} & {T_{\mathrm{d}} \in \mathbb{B}} & {\wedge} & {T_{\mathbf{i}} \in \mathbb{B}}\end{array}
$$

where

$$
\mathbb{P}_{n}=\left\{P: P \in \mathbb{P} \wedge P<2^{n}\right\}
$$

$$
T_{t} \in\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{\mathbb{B}_{20}} & {\text { if } \quad T_{t} \neq \varnothing} \\ {\mathbb{B}_{0}} & {\text { otherwise }}\end{array}\right.
$$

### The block

The block in Ethereum is the collection of relevant pieces of information (known as the block header), $H,$ together with information corresponding to the comprised transactions, T, and a set of of other block headers U that are known to have a parent equal to the present block's parent's parent (such blocks are known as ommers'). The block header contains several pieces of information:

<b>parentHash</b>: The Keccak 256 -bit hash of the parent block's header, in its entirety; formally $H_{p} .$

<b>ommersHash</b>: The Keccak 256 -bit hash of the om- mers list portion of this block; formally $H_{o} .$

<b>beneficiary</b>: The 160 -bit address to which all fees collected from the successful mining of this block be transferred; formally $H_{c} .$

stateRoot: The Keccak 256 -bit hash of the root node of the state trie, after all transactions are executed and finalisations applied; formally $H_{r} .$

transactionsRoot: The Keccak 256 -bit hash of the root node of the trie structure populated with each transaction in the transactions list portion of the block; formally $H_{t}$.

receiptsRoot: The Keccak 256 -bit hash of the root node of the trie structure populated with the receipts of each transaction in the transactions list portion of the block; formally $H_{e} .$

logsBloom: The Bloom filter composed from in- dexable information (logger address and log top- ics) contained in each log entry from the receipt of each transaction in the transactions list; formally $H_{b}$

difficulty: A scalar value corresponding to the difficulty level of this block. This can be calculated from the previous block's difficulty level and the timestamp; formally $H_{d}$.

number: A scalar value equal to the number of ancestor blocks. The genesis block has a number of zero; formally $H_{i}$.

gasLimit: A scalar value equal to the current limit of gas expenditure per block; formally $H_{l} .$

gasUsed: A scalar value equal to the total gas used in transactions in this block; formally $H_{g} .$

timestamp: A scalar value equal to the reasonable output of Unix's time() at this block's inception; formally $H_{s}$.

extraData: An arbitrary byte array containing data relevant to this block. This must be 32 bytes or fewer; formally $H_{x}$.

mixHash: A 256-bit hash which proves combined with the nonce that a sufficient amount of compuation has been carried out on this block; formally $H_{m} .$

nonce: A 64 -bit hash which proves combined with the mix-hash that a sufficient amount of computation has been carried out on this block; formally $H_{n} .$

Formally, we can refer to a block $B:$

$$
B \equiv\left(B_{H}, B_{\mathrm{T}}, B_{\mathrm{U}}\right)
$$
